# Calculator
Simple calculator app for university made to learn basic android concepts.

(To simplify, it doesn't calculate according to mathematical sequence of operations, but calculates in the order in which operations were entered)

# Guidelines: 
1) Application should provide functionality of both simple and scientific calculator depending on user choice.

2) Main view should provide:
* Choosing calculator type - simple or advanced
* Information about application
* Exit

3) Simple calculator version should provide basic operations on floating point numbers, obligatory:
* Add (+), subtract(-), multiply(*), divide(/).
* Change sign (+/-) - sign changes after, not before entering number.
* Clear   enter/clear   (C/CE)   -   first click deletes number on display and allows entering a new number for further calculation. Double click deletes all calculator registers (unless implemented memory functionality exists).
* All  clear  (AC)  -  deletes all calculator registers  (and optionally memory).
* Displaying result (=).

4) Advanced calculator should implement all simple calculator's operations and also more advanced operations, obligatory:
* Trigonometric functions: sinus (sin), cosinus (cos), tangens (tan).
* Logarithmic functions: natural logarithm (ln), logarithm (log).
* Calculating percents (%).
* Roots (sqrt).
* Powers (x^2), (x^y).
